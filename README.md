# ReWear – Sustainable Fashion Marketplace

**ReWear** is a stylish, responsive web-based platform that promotes circular fashion. Users can browse, swap, or request second-hand clothing items in excellent condition. This initiative aims to reduce fashion waste while connecting conscious consumers.

You can preview the application locally by opening `landingpage.html` and navigating to individual item views via `itempage.html`.
